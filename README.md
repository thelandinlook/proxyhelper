# Proxy Helper
Automatically rename and move proxies from Sony Alpha cameras.

## Full Script:
Removes the "S03" from the video proxy name on the SD Card. It will then move all the video files to a location of your choosing, with the proxy files going into a subfolder called "Proxy".
It will also save your choices in a file called "config.txt".

## Lightweight script:
Only find files with "S03" in the name, and removes that. No moving or aything else.

You'll find instructions in the respective folders for your operating system.

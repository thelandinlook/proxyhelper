    ### Step 1 - Save the bash script
    Save the bash script provided in this repository as a `.sh` file on your local machine.

    ### Step 2 - Open Terminal
    You can open Terminal using Spotlight search (Command + Space), then type "Terminal" and press Enter.

    ### Step 3 - Navigate to the Script
    Use the `cd` command in Terminal to navigate to the folder where you saved the bash script. For example:
    ```
    cd /path/to/the/script
    ```
    _Replace `/path/to/the/script` with the actual path to your script._

    ### Step 4 - Set Execute Permission
    In order for the bash script to be run, you must set the proper permissions. You can do this with the chmod command like this:
    ```
    chmod +x the_script_name.sh
    ```
    _Replace `the_script_name.sh` with the name of your script._

    ### Step 5 - Run the Script
    You can run the script by typing a period followed by a slash `./` and then the script name:
    ```
    ./the_script_name.sh
    ```

    ### Step 6 - Interact with the Script
    Read the prompts that the script provides and respond accordingly. The prompts will guide you to enter the needed directories and perform the copy operation. After the operation completes, you will be given the option to delete the original files.

    _Please replace `the_script_name.sh` with the name you gave to your script. This guide assumes that the Terminal command line interface uses the bash shell, which is standard on macOS. Also, keep in mind that you have to modify `/path/to/the/script` to the path where you saved the bash script._
